Following the changes in Wicket from 1.4 to 1.5 you have to adjust your code for wicket-dnd 0.5:
  * wicket-dnd is now dependent on wicketstuff-jslibraries to provide prototype.js
  * Drops without location are no longer supported, so configure your DropTarget explicitely, e.g. to allow drops on a table without rows: target.dropCenter("table").
  * TODO
